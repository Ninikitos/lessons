        <h3 class="javascript-subtitle">Key features of JavaScript</h3>
        <p class="javascript-subtitle-description">
          Examples of popular websites and mobile applications developed with JavaScript<br>include Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Here are a few reasons why you might consider learning this popular programming language:
        </p>
        <ul class="javascript-feature-items">
          <li class="javascript-feature-item">
            <mark>JavaScript is fast.</mark> It runs immediately within a web browser, reducing load time.
          </li>
          <li class="javascript-feature-item">
            <mark>JavaScript is easy.</mark> Not only is JS a relatively easy language for programmers to learn, but its popularity also makes it easy to recognize and implement.
          </li>
          <li class="javascript-feature-item">
            <mark>JavaScript is interactive.</mark> JS adds noticeable and responsive elements to websites such as zooming capabilities and dropdown menus. These elements enhance the user's experience and make JS an in-demand addition to website development.
          </li>
          <li class="javascript-feature-item">
            <mark>JavaScript gets along</mark> with other programming languages. As a core web language, JS is closely aligned with CSS and HTML (other core languages used to build websites). It also has a variety of frameworks and libraries that programmers can learn to specialize their skills.

        Fifty-five percent of the software developers who participated in the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/" target="_blank" class="link">Statista survey</a> stated that they used HTML/CSS.<br>
        Like JavaScript, HTML and CSS are used for front-end development. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard<br>
        programming language for documents designed for web browser display. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a rule-based language.<br>
        It determines how specific elements should be displayed in a document that is written in a markup language (like HTML).
